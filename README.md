# websh
Websh is a collection of infrastructure daemons that also enable access to Internet features via alternative means such as telephone and SMS.

# websh is now laitos (2017-03-13)
Originally the name "websh" was chosen because the program serves Twilio hook to enable shell access to the computer that runs it. Over the years (1.5 years) the original Twilio hook is retained, but the program has evolved into a much bigger collection of more features and daemon programs, hence it is time for a new project name.

IRC friend zutt recommends the name "laitos" - a cute Finnish word that means institute. So check this out, websh's new home is [laitos](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/laitos).
